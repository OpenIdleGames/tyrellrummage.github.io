	var text = '001: Pique receives the ball, Semedo is free on the right side.<br>002: Pique makes a long pass instead of the easy one.<br>003: Of course with our short players, we can\'t win the ball.<br>004: Semedo can play the ball to Sergi, or go back with Pique.<br>005: Instead, he makes a long pass.<br>006: Against, unreachable for our players.<br>007: Pique receives the ball, he signals Rakitic to run to the open space so he can pass.<br>008: Rakitic puts 0 effort and jogs back so Pique is forced to play with MATS.<br>009: Who is forced to make a long pass that goes nowhere (throw in for Roma).<br>010: Now look at the difference. When Roma has the ball in their own half, only two players (well, actually it\'s only Suarez) apply pressure, so they can make it out from their defensive zone effortless.<br>011: Here, Iniesta decides to shoot instead of stopping and playing a ball to Messi who is completely free on the other side.<br>012: Look here, Umtiti has the ball without any pressure. Semedo asks for the ball on the other side of the pitch.<br>013: Umtiti tries a hard pass and gives the ball to a Roma player.<br>014: Here, Pique wins the ball and Roma players are out of position, perfect for a counter attack.<br>015: So he plays a long ball which Suarez gets down perfecly and plays to Messi.<br>016: Who sets up Sergi perfectly 1 on 1 with the keeper.<br>017: Sadly he wastes the chance, no big deal.<br>018: Look at Semedo here, he\'s looking at the player with the ball which is covered by Sergi and Pique, and leaves Dzeko free on the side.<br>019: Another long ball by Ter Stegen from a goal kick, which of course, Roma players control effortless.<br>020: Roma\'s RB plays a vertical pass parallel to the sideline and that pass alone is enough to break our full defense.<br>021: Fast forward a little bit, Pique recovers a ball, Iniesta and Busquets get the ball to Suarez which is alone because the whole Roma team is in our own half. Problem is Suarez doesn\'t make the easy pass to Messi for him to slot it in, so, chance wasted.<br>022: Again, no pressure on Roma, they are free to go into our own half.<br>023: Even when they\'re IN our own half, they have time to think while we wait instead of pressuring and suffocating them.<br>024: Which leads to a long pass to Dzeko.<br>025: Which leads to a goal.<br>026: Fast forward two minutes. Roma pressure continues, look at all the space free on the left side of the pitch. Just by a having a player there, we could lose those 4 Roma men and progress into the midfield. Instead, Pique is forced to play a long ball.<br>027: Which lands to a Roma player.<br>028: Now Busquets has the ball, look at all the space there is to make a forward pass, but no one shows there, so he can\'t play the ball.<br>029: Now look at this picture. Semedo has the ball. Look at Roma shape. It\'s perfect. Two four-player lines. Now look at us. What\'s Sergi\'s position. LW? RM? Anyway...<br>030: Now look at this one. Iniesta receives the ball from Messi. Thanks to Messi\'s movement, he dragged the whole Roma defense to the left side of the pitch. So Iniesta is free to exploit the space Messi created with his movement.<br>031: Instead, he plays the ball to Messi who is surrounded by Roma players. He loses the ball.<br>032: Now Messi has the ball in an attacking situation, he is drifting towards the right side of the pitch. So, where is Semedo on the right flank to receive a pass and maybe send a cross?<br>033: Look at this picture. Roma pressure is very high. A simple combination of 2 or 3 passes is the only thing needed to overcome that pressure and have an easy path to Roma\'s keeper goal.<br>034: Instead we play with our keeper (the easy way) and he is forced to make a long pass which, again, lands out of the pitch.<br>035: Okay, now he have a free kick in their own half, can you predict how this is going to end?<br>036: Yup, back to square one.<br>037: Here Iniesta loses a ball which leads to a Roma counter.<br>038: Luckily we stop it. Now, Roma players are out of position so we can try to start a counter, right?<br>039: Busquets gifts the ball to a Roma player.<br>040: So now we are pressuring a little bit higher which is good, but there\'s a problem, once they play with the keeper, we no longer press.<br>041: So he can play a useful pass instead of being forced to make a long pass like MATS.<br>042: Now look here, the ball is falling and Pique and Dzeko are challenging for it.<br>043: But, when the ball comes down, Pique doesn\'t even try to mark him so he is free to kill the ball with his chest and play a pass to his overlapping partner. Dzeko did this all game.<br>044: Yet another long ball that Roma wins effortless.<br>045: Here Semedo plays the ball to Messi, but doesn\'t run to complete the one-two. Instead he stays there waiting the return ball, making that whole play useless, since no other player makes himself available.<br>046: Yet again, we let them think what do to by not applying pressure.<br>047: So, after a while, we are able to overcome the pressure, here, Suarez receives the ball.<br>048: He plays to Busquets. Look at the huge gap between the CB and the LB from Roma. Sergi doesn\'t exploit this space and waits there for a ball that will never come.<br>049: Now look at this. 5 Roma players vs 4 Barca players, Pique has no pressure yet still he makes a long pass.<br>050: Then there\'s another long pass which Suarez, unlike Dzeko, is unable to control.<br>051: Now look at their RB, he is completely pressured by Iniesta and has no pass option, so, instead of losing the ball, he dribbles out of the way.<br>052: Look now, he at least can play with the keeper and avoid making a long pass to the air.<br>053: He actually passes the ball to a player, and look how easily they get near to our goal. Lets count the passes: 1.<br>054: 2.<br>055: 3.<br>056: Boom! 3 passes, as simple as that.<br>057: A little bit later. Dzeko pressures Umtiti which is forced to kick the ball out of the pitch.<br>058: Yet another long ball because nobody is showing in the midfield.<br>059: Which, of course, we don\'t win.<br>060: Here Pique signals Semedo to play the ball to Busquets (or make a long pass).<br>061: He then realizes it\'s a really hard pass so he shows up for the one-two. Look how easy they lost two men there. That\'s what needed to do all game.<br>062: Here, Messi has the ball and waits for someone to make a move or show up, every other player on our team is static, so he can\'t really do anything besides trying to dribble the whole team.<br>063: Here Pique makes a defense splitting pass to Rakitic, this breaks the line of pressure that Roma put and allows us to create a chance.<br>064: Rakitic stars to run with the ball, but Sergi is marked. He should, instead be on the wing which is completely free. This is the reason Valverde got the line-up wrong. Dembele was needed to stretch the opposition.<br>065: Rakitic then loses the ball.<br>066: Another Ter Stegen long ball that Roma defender wins easily. Again look how easily they get in a dangerous position. Ready? Let\'s count the number of passes: 1.<br>067: 2.<br>068: 3.<br>069: Boom! Again. 3 passes and they are inside our box.<br>070: After a corner, Iniesta receives the ball alone. He can bring it down and start a counter, right?<br>071: Well, he doesn\'t. He gifts it to a Roma player with a headed pass. Look how lonely Messi is, it was the perfect ocasion for a counter attack.<br>072: Look here. Messi has the ball and starts a run.<br>073: He plays the ball to Sergi who instead of playing the ball back to Messi, slows the play down and allows Roma to get in position.<br>074: Then he has the ball and there\'s no pressure on him.<br>075: But instead of going forward, he plays back to Rakitic. So we start again.<br>076: After a few second the ball goes back to Pique.<br>077: Look at Pique here. He can\'t do anything but play the ball back. Why? Because Rakitic is standing still instead of trying to lose his mark. Because Iniesta is on the other side of the pitch, blocked by a Roma player, instead of getting close to Pique to help him out.<br>078: Dzeko yet again winning an aerial duel against Pique, and without much of an effort.<br>079. Here, both Umtiti and Pique are sleeping, and they leave a Roma player alone in the box, who miraculously misses the goal.<br>080: Yet another MATS goal kick which is a gift to Roma.<br>081: Look here. The ball falls to Rakitic who has no man marking him, and, instead of heading it down his teammate (like Roma players did all the game) he just heads it high with no destination.<br>082: Same situation as always. High pressure, Semedo/Pique with the ball.<br>083: Ball back to MATS, forced to play a long ball.<br>084: Lost possession once again.<br>085: Look how bad we are playing that even Messi comes down to defend.<br>086: Pique long ball back in the menu.<br>087: Jordi wins the ball.<br>088: Gifts it.<br>089: Look at the Roma player that has the ball.<br>090: He is free to run, because Sergi, Busquets and Rakitic are standing there without doing anything. Then he plays a pass to Kolarov which, of course, is free on the left side.<br>091: Semedo wins the ball, plays to Sergi who plays to Rakitic. Look at all the space he has behind him. He can start a counter because 5 Roma players are out of position.<br>092: Instead he plays to Pique, aand back to square one.<br>093: Here, Busquets plays to ball to MATS. Look how casually Rakitic jogs back instead of sprinting to give MATS a passing option.<br>094: No surprise here, MATS is forced to make a long pass.<br>095: Which, as you can guess, ends in Roma gaining possession.<br>096: Another MATS goal kick that is a long ball.<br>097: For once, our pressure worked so Iniesta wins the ball and plays it to Suarez.<br>098: Suarez missplaces a simple pass to Messi and loses possession.<br>099: Another long ball from Pique because Roma\'s pressure.<br>100: That ends in Roma gaining possession.<br>101: Another MATS goal kick that is a long ball.<br>102: Which ends, once again, in Roma gaining possession of the ball.<br>103: After a lot of time we have the possession comfortably in their own half.<br>104: But Iniesta gifts the ball to Roma.<br>105: End of firs half.<br>106: Second half underway.<br>107: Thirteen seconds is all they need to get a throw in next to our corner.<br>108: Take a look at our pressing. Right away you can see why it doesn\'t work. Two key points. 1) We only are pressing in one side of the pitch. 2) Their midfielders actually show up so they can just make a simple pass.<br>109: Same story as the first half, they pressure, Pique is being forced to play a long pass.<br>110: And we lose possession.<br>111: Same but with Umtiti.<br>112. Busquets makes a great pass to Iniesta which breaks the first pressure line.<br>113: But Iniesta tries a backheel that goes nowhere.<br>114: Long ball to Dzeko that he controls exquisitely.<br>115: And then makes an even better pass that starts a dangerous play. Notice how Busquets doesn\'t keep up with Dzeko and he is left alone.<br>116: After a rebound, Suarez gets the ball and can start a counter attack.<br>117: But the Roma defender forces a throw in, which we then proceed to send to MATS, again, without being able to advance into Roma\'s half.<br>118: As you can see here, Roma actually uses the width of the pitch to its own advantage.<br>119: Here Messi wins the ball and plays it to Suarez.<br>120: However, he takes too long and when he makes the pass to Messi, he\'s already marked.<br>121: After that situation of danger, Roma cleared the ball and we had a moment of control.<br>122: A play between Messi and Jordi doesn\'t work and we are caught up out of position.<br>123: Fast forward a little bit. As you can see, they are still pressing and our players are not making themselves available for a pass, so Umtiti is forced to play the ball to MATS.<br>124: Here, Iniesta holds onto the ball for too much and loses it.<br>125: This leave us in a dangerous situation.<br>126: Yet another long ball by MATS, that we, again, can\'t win.<br>127: A Roma player plays a ball to Dzeko, which is marked by Pique, and has Umtiti very close (2-3m)<br>128: However, Umtiti doesn\'t help Pique who\'s struggling to mark Dzeko so he fouls him and it\'s a penalty.<br>129: Which De Rossi converts.<br>130: Rakitic plays a long ball to no one.<br>131: Yet again MATS is forced to play a long ball.<br>132: Which of course Roma wins.<br>133: Suarez try to pass to Jordi, an easy pass, right?<br>134: Well, he misses the pass and Roma gains possession of the ball.<br>135: Look at this image. We have a 5 man line.<br>136: Yet still leave Nainggolan completely alone.<br>137: Look here how alone Semedo is. Umtiti should play the ball to him to abandon this left area that is crowded.<br>138: But he doesn\'t, he plays the ball to Jordi.<br>139: Which passes to Iniesta and after a few second, thanks to Roma\'s pressure, the ball is back to MATS.<br>140: Twelve (12) seconds later, the same.<br>141: And once again, Roma is in possession.<br>142: Yet another long goal kick.<br>143: Yet another long pass MATS is forced to play.<br>144: Check this out, here, a ball is played to Roma\'s RB. He, like Semedo a lot of the time, doesn\'t have anyone to pass.<br>145: But instead of making the safe pass back, he makes a one-touch pass to Dzeko.<br>146: Who toys with Pique for about ten seconds, then makes a cross.<br>147: And Semedo fails to avoid the Nainggolan shot.<br>148: Another long ball from a goal kick from MATS.<br>149: And we can\'t win position.<br>150: Look here, Sergi receives a ball and has space to turn and attack, instead he plays the safe pass to Rakitic.<br>151: Who makes a long pass and gifts the ball to Roma.<br>152: Again forced to play a long ball, I think this game just reduced MATS pass accuracy by a lot.<br>153: Yet another long goal kick by MATS.<br>154: And of course, we lose possession.<br>155: The same thing, again, and again, and again.<br>156: Our second goal attemp is at the minute 73, from outside the box, an isolated Messi shot that goes straight to the keeper.<br>157: Another long ball goal kick.<br>158: And another long ball goal kick.<br>159: In this one at least, Suarez wins a throw in.<br>160: Once again, Roma effortlessly is in our box.<br>161: Counter for Barca, Iniesta has the ball and Messi shows himself for the pass.<br>162: But Iniesta holds onto he ball for too long and makes a difficult pass that Roma controls easily.<br>163: First sub comes at minute 80. And it\'s Andre Gomes.<br>164: 9 minutes left and our whole team is parking the bus.<br>165: Roma, instead, keeps attacking, wins a corner, and scores a goal.<br>166: And even after scoring a goal, they don\'t sit back, they keep attacking.<br>167: With 5 minutes left to play, Dembele comes in. A player that could provide width in a game where we needed it the most.<br>168: First combination between Messi and Dembele, and we are now approaching their box (at the 85th minute).<br>169: 1 minute from Dembele and he already created a chance that gives us a corner.<br>170: At this point we start pressuring Roma like we should have done the whole game, and they make mistakes and give us possession.<br>171: So, when we press high instead of sitting back, we create chances. We created 2 chances in 3 minutes, the same amount we\'ve created the whole match until that point.<br>172: Minute 89, Roma, which would be eliminated if we scored a goal, keeps attacking.<br>173: Messi sets up Suarez.<br>174: Who shoots but we get a rebound, so that\'s 3 chances created in 4 minutes, different from the 2 chances created in 84 minutes before.<br>175: Rakitic sends a cross directly to Roma\'s keeper.<br>176: 3 minutes to go and Roma keeps pressing.<br>177: Roma keeps attacking.<br>178: Dembele attemps a shot from far away. It was offside before anyway.<br>179: Dzeko keeps playing great and wins a free kick with 1 minute and a half to go.<br>180: End of game.';
